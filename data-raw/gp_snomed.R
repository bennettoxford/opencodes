# * snomed_code (Text string of digits up to 18 characters long)
#   SNOMED concepts which have been added to a patient record in a general practice system during the reporting period.
# * Description (Text string)
#   The fully specified name associated with the snomed_code on the final day of the reporting period (31 July).
# * Usage (Numeric (integer) or *)
#   The number of times that the snomed_code was added into any patient record within the reporting period, rounded to the nearerst 10.
#   Usage of 1 to 4 is displayed as *.
# * Active_at_Start
#   Active status of the snomed_code on the first day of the reporting period.
#   This is taken from the most recent UK clinical extension, or associated International extention, which was published up to the start of the reporting year (1 August).
#   1 = SNOMED concept was published and was active (active = 1).
#   0 = SNOMED concept was either not yet available or was inactive (active = 0).
# * Active_at_End	"Active status of the snomed_code on the first day of the reporting period.
#   This is taken from the most recent UK clinical extension, or associated International extention, which was published up to the end of the reporting year (31 July).
#   1 = SNOMED concept was published and was active (active = 1).
#   0 = SNOMED concept was either not yet available or was inactive (active = 0).

# The following files show the number of times each listed SNOMED code was added to a GP patient record within the period 1 Aug to 31 July for the years available, aggregated at England level.
