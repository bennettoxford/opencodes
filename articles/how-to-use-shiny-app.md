# How to use the Shiny app

## Overview

The `opencodecounts` Shiny app is an interactive tool for exploring
clinical code usage data in England. It visualises trends over time and
helps you search, filter, and analyse clinical codes from three major
coding systems used in the NHS. It can be launched locally with the
[`run_app()`](https://bennettoxford.github.io/opencodecounts/reference/run_app.md)
function or accessed online at
<https://bennettoxford.github.io/opencodecounts/articles/app>.

## Step 1: Select data

The Shiny app has a sidebar to select one of the available datasets
(i.e., SNOMED CT, ICD-10, or OPCS-4) and search for a specific code or a
collection of codes, including codelists from
[OpenCodelists.org](http://opencodelists.org/).

## Step 2: Select codes

The app offers flexible ways to select codes for analysis:

1.  Search by code: If you know exact codes, start typing and select
    from suggestions
2.  Enter keywords to find codes (use `|` to combine terms, e.g.,
    `diabetes|diabetic`)
3.  Load codelist by URL from
    [OpenCodelists.org](http://opencodelists.org/).

## Step 3: Review your results

There are three main tabs to review the results:

**Trends over time**: You can explore visualisations summarising overall
trends and inspect individual code usage over time. You can hover over
data points for detailed information. Toggle “Show individual codes” to
see separate lines for each code (available when ≤500 codes selected).

**Usage table**: A table provides key statistics on the frequency and
proportional contribution of selected codes across all years.

**Selected codes**: Additionally, the app presents a structured list of
all selected codes along with their descriptions and a column
specifiying if usage data was reported. This list can be downloaded as a
CSV file for use in EHR research or for upload to
[OpenCodelists.org](http://opencodelists.org/).
