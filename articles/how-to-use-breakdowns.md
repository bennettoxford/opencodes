# How to use ICD-10 and OPCS-4 breakdowns

## Overview

Breakdowns allow you to go beyond total usage counts and explore how
ICD-10 and OPCS-4 codes are used across different patient groups and
clinical contexts. For more information on all datasets available in
this package see the [available
datasets](https://bennettoxford.github.io/opencodecounts/articles/available-datasets.md)
vignette.

1.  **Position**: Describe the count of main diagnosis (vs all dignoses)
    for inpatient treatment and the main procedures (vs all procedures)
    recorded for each available code;
2.  **Sex**: female, male, and gender unknown;
3.  **Age**: mostly 5-year age groups from 0 to 90 plus.

See the full list of ICD-10 breakdowns in the results below. The same
breakdowns are available for OPCS-4, but the position breakdowns are
called `all_procedures` and `main_procedure` instead.

## Worked examples

In these examples we’re exploring the code usage for the ICD-10 code
[F90.0 (Disturbance of activity and
attention)](https://icd.who.int/browse10/2010/en#/F90.0), which is used
to record Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The
underlying data structure looks like this:

``` r

icd10_adhd_breakdowns <- icd10_usage_breakdowns |>
  filter(icd10_code == "F900")

icd10_adhd_breakdowns
#> # A tibble: 377 × 6
#>    start_date end_date   icd10_code description                 breakdown  usage

### Calculating the percentage of main diagnosis coding

Calculating what proportion of usage is recorded as a main diagnosis
helps distinguish between codes used to describe the primary reason for
admission and those capturing co-existing conditions.

``` r

adhd_diag_positions <- icd10_adhd_breakdowns |>
  filter(breakdown %in% c("all_diagnoses", "main_diagnosis")) |>
  group_by(icd10_code, description, breakdown) |>
  summarise(n = sum(usage), .groups = "drop") |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = breakdown, values_from = n) |>
  mutate(pct_main_diagnosis = round(main_diagnosis / all_diagnoses * 100, 2))

adhd_diag_positions
#> # A tibble: 1 × 5
#>   icd10_code description         all_diagnoses main_diagnosis pct_main_diagnosis
#>   <chr>      <chr>                       <int>          <int>              <dbl>
#> 1 F900       Disturbance of act…        538927           3610               0.67
```

Only 0.67% of F90.0 coding is recorded as the main diagnosis, indicating
that ADHD is typically recorded as a co-existing condition and not the
main condition being treated.

### Visualising trends in sex breakdowns

``` r

# Define all x axis breaks
x_breaks <- unique(icd10_adhd_breakdowns$end_date)

# Create figure for sex breakdowns
fig_adhd_sex_breakdowns <- icd10_adhd_breakdowns |>
  filter(breakdown %in% c("male", "female", "gender_unknown")) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = end_date, y = usage, colour = breakdown, shape = breakdown)) +
  geom_line(alpha = .3) +  
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_x_date(breaks = x_breaks, labels = label_date("%b\n%Y")) +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(end = .7, option = "C") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Usage count", colour = NULL, shape = NULL)

### Visualising trends in age breakdowns

``` r

# Define short x axis breaks (only every 4th reporting period)
x_breaks_short <- x_breaks[seq(1, length(x_breaks), by = 4)]

# Create figure for age breakdowns
fig_adhd_age_breakdowns <- icd10_adhd_breakdowns |>
  filter(str_starts(breakdown, "age")) |> 
  mutate(breakdown = reorder(breakdown, parse_number(breakdown))) |>
  ggplot(aes( x = end_date, y = usage, colour = breakdown)) +
  geom_line(alpha = .3) +  
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_x_date(breaks = x_breaks_short, labels = label_date("%b\n%Y")) +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(end = .75) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Usage count",colour = NULL, shape = NULL) +
  theme(legend.position = "none", panel.spacing = unit(.4, "cm")) +
  facet_wrap(~breakdown, ncol = 4)
