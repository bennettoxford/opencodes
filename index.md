# opencodecounts

The `opencodecounts` R package provides easy access to yearly summaries
of clinical code usage in England. The package makes NHS England’s
published datasets available in R and an interactive online tool,
covering SNOMED CT codes in primary care and ICD-10/OPCS-4 codes in
secondary care.

You can launch the interactive Shiny app by clicking on [*Launch Shiny
app*](https://bennettoxford.github.io/opencodecounts/articles/app.html).
For work in R, all available functions (including datasets) are
documented in the [*R
Reference*](https://bennettoxford.github.io/opencodecounts/reference/index.html)
section.

## Installation

You can install the `opencodecounts` package in R with:
